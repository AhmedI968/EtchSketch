# Etch-A-Sketch Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Etch-A-Sketch project! I'm taking on this challenge to enhance my DOM manipulation skills by building a browser-based version of a sketchpad. My goal is to create an interactive canvas where users can draw and engage with a virtual Etch-A-Sketch toy.

## Functionality

Once completed, the Etch-A-Sketch project will include the following features:

### Drawing Canvas

- A responsive area where users can draw by clicking and dragging the mouse or using touch input.
- The canvas will adjust its size based on user preferences or settings.

### Clear Canvas Button

- A button that allows users to clear the canvas with a single click, resetting it to its initial state.

### Resize Canvas

- An option for users to adjust the size of the drawing area, either through predefined settings or custom input.

### Color Options (Optional)

- A feature to select different colors for drawing, giving users the ability to customize their artwork.

### Responsive Design

- The canvas and controls will be designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.
